Follow PLAYBOOK.md exactly. Implement the entire system end-to-end.

Non-negotiable: multi-agent council with one PM orchestrator and distinct role prompts in /prompts.

Create prompt files in /prompts:
- topic_researcher.md
- scripture_mapper.md
- content_composer.md
- formatter.md
- interlinker.md
- safety_officer.md
- publisher.md

Implement a PM orchestrator that runs roles sequentially:
1) Topic Researcher -> data/topics.csv (20 LOW-risk queries + cluster/topic)
2) Scripture Mapper -> data/verse_maps/{slug}.json (zod-validated)
3) Content Composer -> data/drafts/{slug}.mdx (MDX template)
4) Formatter (optional, local Ollama OK)
5) Interlinker (optional, local Ollama OK)
6) Safety Officer (OpenAI only) -> veto to data/flagged with reason
7) Publisher -> copy approved drafts into biible-content-site/src/content/questions and open PR using GH_TOKEN + CONTENT_REPO

Hard rules:
- No full verse quotes; references + brief context only
- Stop + flag HIGH-risk topics: salvation/hell, sexuality, politics, end-times, divorce/remarriage
- Every MDX page includes:
  - H1 exact query
  - Intro
  - Key passages
  - Common follow-up questions linking to https://biible.net?q={urlencoded}
  - Footer: Scripture doesn’t change. Tools do. Biible.net supports study; it doesn’t replace pastoral counsel.

Add npm scripts:
- ags:run
- ags:cloud (CLOUD_MODE=true disables Ollama and uses OpenAI for all roles)

Make it minimal but fully working with clear logs.
